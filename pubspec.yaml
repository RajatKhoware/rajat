  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf

    - family: IrishGrover
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/IrishGrover-Regular.ttf

    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
